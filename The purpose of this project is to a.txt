The purpose of this project is to acquire the remote electrical parameters like voltage, current 
and frequency and send these real time values over network using IoT module along with 
temperature and relative humidity at power station. This project is also designed to protect the 
electrical circuitry by operating an SPDT relay. This relay gets activated whenever the 
electrical parameters exceed or fall behind the predefined values. The relay can be used to 
switch off the main electrical supply. User can send commands to the microcontroller to read 
the remote electrical parameters. This system also can automatically send the real time 
electrical parameters periodically (based on time settings). This system can be designed to send 
alerts whenever the relay trips or whenever the voltage or current exceeds the predefined limits. 
This project makes use of a microcontroller, in this prototype for demonstration purpose we 
have used ESP-WROOM-32. The controller can efficiently communicate with the different 
sensors being used. The controller is provided with some internal memory to hold the code. 
This memory is used to dump some set of assembly instructions into the controller.
